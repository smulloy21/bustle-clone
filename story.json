    "text": "Happy Rex Manning Day? Prepare to feel old, guys, because the cult classic Empire Records turns 20 this year. While it hardly holds a candle to Clerks, in my opinion, it's still an viable window into Gen X and the accompanying aesthetics. See, the incredible '90s style in Empire Records helps tell the story behind each of the heroines... and even if it didn't, the fashion is so fun to watch in action on screen."

Kermit and Miss Piggy, the stars of the upcoming ABC show The Muppets, had a highly publicized split in August and, since then, have both been the subject of a great deal of rumors, from Kermit's relationship with ABC co-worker Denise to Miss Piggy's involvement with celebrities from Liam Hemsworth to Josh Groban."

    "text": "Whether you consider yourself a pumpkin spice latte devotee, or you favor a nice glass of cider, there’s nothing quite like kicking the colder weather off with seasonal fall drinks. While you can enjoy flavors like pumpkin, apple, and caramel anytime of year, there is something about the changing colors of leaves and crisp, chilly air that inspires us to sip on drinks that keep us cozy — or just seem to taste like fall. And when you add some coffee to that mix, things couldn’t possibly get any better."
